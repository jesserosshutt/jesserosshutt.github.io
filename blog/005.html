			<h1>005 - JAVASCRIPT BASICS</h1>
			<p>Before getting into some JavaScript, there are a few other things we should tackle first.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is a computer programming language which runs natively in your browser, that uses logic to manipulate, store data, make calculations and much more.</p>
			<p>It took a little bit of time to get my head around the term logic.  Instead of using mathematical equations as you might think a computer language uses, it uses a more simple logical step by step system to use data. Of course it can use tricky mathematical equations but uses logic first to implement them. How Javascript is so powerful is that it uses The DOM to manipulate the HTML document.</p>
			<p>I think before getting to The DOM we need to address HTML and CSS. If HTML were a person, CSS would be their clothes. People have a head, most people have feet and they’ve got a body with a bit of different stuff going on. If we look at a regular website, just like a person you’ll see that it has structure. A head, maybe a footer at the bottom and a body that has articles and pictures, this is HTML. CSS now gives that person style; some clothes, some colours and an artistic feel. On a webpage CSS gives HTML placement, colour, borders.</p>
			<p>The DOM stands for document object model. What this means is that it organises our HTML document into branches and nodes of ‘objects’, not literal objects but collections of data. It would look like an upside down tree if it were drawn down on paper. What Javascript can now do is access this DOM tree and do the things it does well.</p>
			<p>To use Javascript we first need to understand data types and variables. Data types can be numbers, words or values of true or false. Variables are like storage containers and they are assigned these data types but they can also hold arrays and objects.</p>
			<p>Arrays and objects are like variables in that they store data. Arrays are like the older cousin of variables and objects are the even older cousin of arrays. Variables store one piece of information and arrays can store multiple pieces of information. Objects store multiple pieces of information as well but in a slightly different way, they have a key and value system.</p>
			<p>For instance a variable can equal 1 or ‘blue’ but an array can equal 1 and ‘blue’ and ‘large’ and true and ‘round’.  Objects can store name, age, address and contact keys with the value attached to them.</p>
			<p>Now that we understand data types, variables, arrays and objects we can now move on to the core of Javascript, functions.</p>
			<p>Functions are incredibly useful and use the above data types, variables, arrays and objects with conditional statements and loops to execute actions.These actions could be changing the colour of something when you click on it or helping to store your personal data so that you can be remembered.</p>
			<p>Conditional statements are a rather simple concept I think. They consist of if, else if and else parts. If the condition is met, execute the code, if it is not met then it moves onto the next condition and so on. The best way I can describe them would be making dinner. If you have all the ingredients you make dinner, else you make do with what you have or finally if that won’t work you’ll have to go down to the shop to pick up some more ingredients.</p>
			<p>Loops are the final piece of the Javascript basics pie and they exactly what they sound like they’ll do, loop. In a function they will loop over certain pieces of data to gather the information or put in new information. You can loop over a page and add in 1000’s of ‘I love you’s or you can loop over a table and gather the results of a test then use the function to get the average.</p>
			<p>This is just the start of what Javascript can do, so can keep reading if you want to find out more.</p>
