			<h1>002 - CSS BOX MODEL</h1>
			<p>If you are new to programming like myself, the box model may come as a rather foreign concept.</p>
			<p>Every website is made up of elements with content inside of them. Simply put, small or large pieces of information on a webpage can and is put into a box. This is how we get the box model.</p>
			<p>All boxes are then sized and styled with height, width, padding, borders and margins.</p>
			<img class="half-size-img" src="../images/css-box-model.png" alt="" />
			<p>It starts with the content. Whether you have a paragraph, heading, image or icon, the box will start with that given size of the content you have given it. You can now change the size of the content with width and height properties to make the area smaller or larger at your will.</p>
			<img src="../images/css-box-model-height.png" alt="" />
			<p>Seems pretty simple right.. you put content in and that’s the size of the box, which you can make bigger or smaller. Now comes the tricky part.. padding.</p>
			<p>The best way to describe padding is to first put a border around our content. If we step away from websites for a moment and think of a painting that might be hung on a wall.</p>
			<p>We have our content of which is the painting, drawing or photo. This is the content area. More often than not you will have this content framed, this will be your border. You can have large frames with all the fine detailing or you can have thin plan frames to not take your eye away from the content within. This is exactly the same with content on a webpage. You have your original content, say an image, where you can have a border around it that you can style. Be it thin or thick, dotted and coloured, this border will wrap around your content.</p>
			<img src="../images/css-box-model-border.png" alt="" />
			<p>Now if we go back to our content hanging on the wall again, let’s think of a photo this time. The photograph will have its frame, then a mat board creating negative space around the photograph. This negative space is called padding. By default it is very small but you can style the padding as large as you like and also in which direction you would like. Sometimes you would like that negative space higher on the top and bottom, then smaller on the left and right.</p>
			<img src="../images/css-box-model-padding.png" alt="" />
			<p>Before we move onto the last piece of the box model puzzle we have to go back to our content area. Content and content area must not be confused, which is easy to do. If you think of content you must only think of the painting or photograph. With content area this includes the border, padding and content. Let’s say we have a picture that was 20cm wide. The content width would be 20cm but the content area width would not be 20cm because we haven’t added our frame and negative space. To calculate the content area width we would have add our left border of 1cm, our left padding of 5cm, our content of 20cm, our right padding of 5cm again and finally our right border of 1cm totalling 32cm all up!</p>
			<img src="../images/css-box-model-total.png" alt="" />
			<p>This may not seem so useful now but when you go to move content around your page it does. If you wanted to know if that photograph in the gallery fitted in that space you’ve always to fill in your hallway, you wouldn’t just measure the photograph would you? You would most definitely measure the frame, padding and photograph, end to end.</p>
			<p>Now finally we have made it to our margin property. This is probably the easiest to explain since we’ve gotten through all the rest. The margin is simply the space outside of the box. It can be styled in a similar fashion to the padding property where you can have it your way with the top, bottom left and right values. Don’t forget that every other box has a margin too.</p>
