            <h1>006 - NEUROPLACTICITY</h1>
            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
            <p>Having an understanding of neuroplasticity can change the way you learn. Understanding that intelligence is learnt and by the strengthening of your neurotransmitters, you can learn faster and retain information for longer.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>The principle of neuroplasticity is that you make connections in your brain like roads and highways. The more you need to use certain information the stronger the connection becomes like the more cars that are going to a certain place the roads become larger like highways.</p>
            <p>Trying to use the information you are learning more often and using it in different ways helps make the connections stronger.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>Repetition and different scenarios. Try to use your information more often and create different ways with how to use it. Also just imaging how to do it helps. The act of doing something and the act of thinking about doing it are actually quite similar in the way of making strong connections.</p>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>What is it and why it is relevant?</h3>
            <p>A growth mindset is a mindset that embraces challenges and sees effort as the path to mastery. Knowing and understanding that no one is gifted and it’s the effort you put in. It is to think in your mind that nothing is too hard and that you are just not there yet. You understand that a bit of hard work and perseverance will pay off, it’s the ability to know your brain will grow.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How will I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey?</h3>
            <p>I think just knowing that I am not expected to be perfect yet and some things will be tough for me and other things will be tough for others. We are all here to learn and if we are all willing to put in the effort we will succeed in this.</p>
