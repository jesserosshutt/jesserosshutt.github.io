			<h1>003 - IDENTITY VALUE STRENGTH</h1>
			<h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
			<p>The start of the covid pandemic I had to make a choice to whether or not, the team I managed and myself, would keep working through the lockdown. This was in London and there was a lot of uncertainty around what was going to happen and what we could do. It was a keep everyone safe or temporarily shut the business down with everyones jobs on the line. Being an 'essential' business I decided that we would stay working keeping everyones jobs safe. We all cycled to work and had small bubbles and felt like the best thing to do. Being fit and healthy, it felt like the right decision as staff being from outside the UK would have a rather hard time and potentially have to leave the country and posibly big finanial burdens. In retrospect, I'm proud of what we did and glad everyone still has homes and jobs but should have thought about our health and safety.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
			<p>I supose growing up in a low economic area gave me a diverse up upbringing. Being surrounded by many cultures and ethinicities gives you understanding and patience. Seeing this from being young has opened my eyes to a forever expanding mindset. Knowing we are small and there is so much out there and to be humble.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
			<p>My strengths lie with big thinking and problem solving. A little bit of a day dreamer and always thinking about the future, I can tend to run before I can walk. I am very dedicated though and believe that will get me through this.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
			<p>Being a very percise and compulsive person I will have to know all the code off by hand. This will be great when others forget commands and syntax but could hinder speed and production. I have managed a production line for the last few years and those skills would be good for directing projects.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
			<p>In my last job where I was a coffee roaster, I had a quality control assistant. We tended to butt heads often with how we wanted things to taste. Sometimes it become very sour and other times we perfectly in unison. I think letting go of a bit of ego and letting others have a bit of shine helps with no just relationship but has a more diverse result.</p>
