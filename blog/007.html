      <h1>007 - PROBLEMS</h1>
      <p>While learning Web Development, you’ll run into many problems. If not so many problems that many many people claim that web development is just problem solving in itself.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I don’t like to call them problems but rather blocks or issues and we problem solve to solve these blocks and issues. Sometimes these ‘problems’ can be very simple and others where you have absolutely have no clue.</p>
      <br />
      <p>At this point you really need to understand what the problem solving course of action is. What direction do you take, what is the path, where do you start and what resources you can use to get you through to the end.</p>
      <br />
      <p>So, where do you start? I think the best idea is to really understand what it is that you have been asked. Really getting a grip of what needs to go in and what needs to come out. You can break down or reorganise your question. Write it down in a clear step by step order so you understand what's going in and write out in plain english what it is that needs to come out.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This is called Pseudocoding. You are not actually writing code but you are writing how it is going to work. Pseudocoding really helps with mental space and can help you approach the task. It’s all syntax after that.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Make sure when you do start writing your code, name your functions and variables clearly! I cannot stress this enough. In the beginning it is hard to remember all the syntax but if you don’t name your functions and variables clearly you’ll get even more lost. When you look at your code from afar or a quick glance, you want to know what is going on as fast as possible. You really don’t want to be looking at that variable and thinking ‘what the hell is that for’ or ‘where does that go’.</p>
      <br />
      <p>When you name your variables clearly you can have a far clearer mental map of what is happening. For an example it's far easier to understand what ‘n’ does if you name it ‘numVar’ or ‘numbersVariable’. As you read code more, you’ll understand a shorter naming style but at the start I would recommend giving your variables as much distinction as possible.</p>
      <br />
      <p>As you move through your code, I like to log the value as much as I can. I really find this helps with finding at which point your code is breaking. Just log log log I recommend. Declare your function then log. Find it information you need to access then log it. Start applying your conditions and log at every point.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This really helps to get down to the single point of where your code is breaking. You don’t want to write out all your code, then it breaks and you spend countless amounts of time on swapping syntax out or reorganising code, putting in if/else statements instead of loops, all to find out that you’ve forgotten a curly brace somewhere.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Trust me, it’s the worst and you waste a lot of time. Log everything, it really helps.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Being able to read these error messages from the console is well worth your time also. The error message can tell you to the line where your code is breaking. It also gives you some handy unexpected syntax and variable undefined error messages too. Make sure you read these and work out what it is sending you back.</p>
      <br />
      <p>After all this you are still going to run into issues. This is where your problem solving skills come in.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Having good googling skills helps. If you can google what exactly you want and have it return then that is perfect but a lot of the time you can't find what you are after. Really breaking it down and using the right terminology gives you a clearer result.</p>
      <br />
      <p>You can also ask your peers, teachers and code friends for help. It is always good to have a second set of eyes on your code, someone else might just have the vision for what you are missing.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Before going to your mates you can also use the rubber ducky method where having said your issue out loud can be the trigger to where you have gone wrong or something you have missed. So, grab your rubber ducky and break down your issue and say it out loud, chances are you will have the light bulb moment.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The rubber ducky method has definitely been a help for me. My family see that I’m a bit stressed so I take some time out to tell them what I’m going through and just by doing this gives me a few ideas to try.</p>
      <br />
      <p>While learning web development, I’ve taken physical notes the whole time. It has been lengthy but I can assure you that it definitely helps with the learning process. Having something that you can flick through in an order that you have learned it.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I had an issue with a code challenge and I was stressed, I got angry at the screen and had doubt in my abilities. I went through every step. I wrote it out. Pseudo coded and googled. I youtubed and I talked it out. I console logged it all the way and I just couldn’t get back the information that I was after. The final thing I could do was to go back through my notes and relearn objects and arrays. It was so handy being able to go through all of the relevant information on these sections. My notes were bullet points and code examples. And there it was, I had missed a whole layer of an object by forgetting bracket notation.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I’ll probably never forget this now (fingers crossed) but it was something I had learned and it had totally slipped my mind. By forgetting it existed, I wasn’t able to google it or write it in my pseudo code. This is why reflection is crucial to learning and having your own notes, in your own voice, can bring you back to those moments you learned it. Learn, practice, store it somewhere in your own language and reflect back on it.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Javascript is hard but rewarding. There’s nothing better than problem solving your way through hard code. We’ll get better at problem solving and along the way, write more eloquent Javascript.</p>
