			<h1>004 - EQ AND IQ</h1>
			<p>Coming to Dev Academy, we have been faced with not only technical skills for web development but also core and identity skills. This week we have dived into emotional intelligence (or EQ for short) to help us on our journey through our developer bootcamp and setting us up with good habits for the rest of our lives.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>So, what is EQ?</h3>
			<p>Emotional intelligence is to be aware of emotions and to manage them accordingly. To look inside yourself, understand what is happening and to have control. Often we have a lot of tension and anxiety floating around and having control over this can be a powerful tool.</p>
			<p>Itâ€™s not just being able to manage your own emotions but to also acknowledge other peoples. How to recognise how people are feeling and how to act accordingly. Having skills to read other people is an important leadership and life skill.</p>
			<p>EQ is a learned intelligence as well. You can train to have better mental habits of attention and mindfulness all adding to to your EQ skillset.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
			<p>IQ is a standardised test to assess the potential intelligence of people. It separates people into categories of smartness but has no relevance to how people will do in life or in fact most skills in life. It fails to have any sort of measurement of the wider definition of human intelligence, creativity, social or emotional intelligence.</p>
			<p>I like to think of IQ as a potential weapon and without EQ it will never be used to its full potential.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
			<p>Without a good emotional skill set you cannot access your highest potential. Without having control of your attention you will not have peak performance. Without understanding others you will not be able to have objectiveness. Without emotional intelligence you cannot have self knowledge and mastery</p>
			<p>This also leads into the workplace as well. With better performance and understanding of others you will be a better fit for leadership.</p>
			<p>Having a good EQ will give you more potential to receive personal success, excellence and happiness.</p>
