			<h1>001 - CHANGE</h1>
			<p>After 12 years in the coffee industry it’s time for change. In this blog I am going to share my journey of becoming a web developer and ask myself some core questions.</p>
            <p>As my first blog entry I will share my learning path and ask myself how a plan to get there.</p>
        <br/>
			<h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
			<p>I have always enjoyed computers, engineering and any technical part of coffee. My career change decision came from doing some programming of machinery I used. It was very minor but became fascinated with the idea of programming machines.</p>
            <p>This took me to web development, a rapidly growing industry with lots of support and courses. My ideal path is to make apps and programmes to help the current coffee industry and to then progress into tools, machinery and robotics that would help and grow the next generation of coffee.</p>
        <br/>
			<h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>I haven’t been very ‘social’ out there on the world wide web. I would definitely like to grow this skill of confidence and get myself out there a lot more. I see a lot of value in this and know that people are interested in my life and journey so why keep that from them.</p>
        <br/>
			<h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations?</h3>
            <p>I believe I am very committed and determined to complete this change. I like to think big and aim for the stars. Natural born problem solver and ponder over ideas. Maybe I do tend to ponder too much and might hinder production but I hope the determination will help me to break through and get it done.</p>
        <br/>
			<h3>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h3>
			<p>Managing my workload is a little bit difficult to estimate right now seeing as I haven’t started the bootcamp. I would like to think that I’ve taken out a lot of life's distractions and cleared my head enough to dedicate all my time and energy to this.</p>
            <p>I have done my research on productivity and mindfulness to get everything out of this that I can. Avoid burn out and take breaks when they are needed.</p>
        <br/>
			<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h3>
            <p>So far Google has been my best friend. It has been the best tool for questions that I’ve needed solved. I do know that other students will be in the same position as me so I will need to reach out to them as someone will have answered it already and two heads are always better than one. We do have facilitators to ask for help but I believe this a last option as once we are out by ourselves there won’t be someone to hold my hand through it.</p>
        <br/>
			<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
            <p>I do hope they will guide me through to the potential I can achieve. I don’t expect a piggy back but I know they can help support me to get through this whether it be technical or mentally. Some concepts can be tricky to grasp so I am looking forward to some real world people to help explain these.</p>
        <br/>
            <p>To end this first post, I give myself good luck. You have cleared your diary and head. There is nothing else to do apart from this. Happy learning to myself and to whoever reads this, I hope you enjoy it.</p>
