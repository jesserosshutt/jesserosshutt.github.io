      <h1>010 - REFLECTION</h1>
      <p>It has been five weeks into my learning journey. In this post I will be revisiting my first entry and going over the first questions I asked myself.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>My thoughts on this are still rather similar in that I would like to make apps for the coffee industry. I guess I can also see that it doesn’t just have to be big. I’ve learnt a lot of new skills so there are a lot more things I can do now. This course has opened my mind in terms of what else can be done and is very exciting.</p>
      <p>I would also like to work in a team. Having spent this time at home studying has made me realise how much I do miss being around people. Being in an environment with some great programmers where I can continue learning.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>I have been very dedicated through this spending most of my days and weekends here at the computer. Being very thorough has been a strength I think that has come out since starting. Being able to read questions, write down my approach and execute with not too much beating around the bush. This will definitely be a big help in the bootcamp as I know it is short and intense. There’s not a lot of time to waste and being thorough from the start of each project will help with lost time.</p>
      <p>I still think my procrastination has been a limitation but I think this becomes slightly better with each project and the more I learn.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>Keeping focused for 9 weeks of intense learning is certainly going to be difficult. I do get side tracked so I really do hope I can stay on top of the workload and get through this.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of things I’m looking forward to while at EDA. I have never studied before and therefore looking forward to gaining skills of focus, writing, working with people I’ve never met before and performance. Also getting out there and showing off the work I’ve done as I’ve never had the chance before I shy away so am looking forward to gaining confidence with interactions about what I’ve made.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>I hope I do very well in the boot camp. I’ve changed countries to do this so I think I’m pretty dedicated. I’ve stripped my calendar and have nothing else apart from this to do.</p>
      <p>The group of students seem to be just as eager to learn, so I’m sure they’ll all be a good source of inspiration, guidance and help. Not just for learning the technical parts but mental support and motivation. The facilitators also have been a help already and looking forward to their help and guidance.</p>
