      <h1>008 - CORE</h1>
      <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>Putting your ego to the side is a great personal practice. I think you don’t realise how much your ego affects your learning or progress or even opportunities. Your ego tells you you need to be the best or do this the fastest, where in reality no one cares about that and it’s only yourself and your ego that benefit or hindered. Removing your ego and focusing on getting through this with good comprehension is what will help you progress and become a great programmer.</p>
      <p>I’ve also really benefited from being more organised. I’ve been writing down things in my planner step by step. This has allowed me to be more productive by being able to keep track of where I’m up to and more motivated to complete it. I’m usually a pretty organised person but never this organised and far more motivated and can see it moving along.</p>
      <p>Finally I believe just the core learning in general has given me a bit more confidence in myself to achieve things that I didn’t think were possible. By impossible not so much just that train of thought, oh wouldn’t that be great if I could do that or wouldn’t it be great if that was like that. Having a bit of confidence and knowing by taking the right steps those things are entirely possible and possibly easier than you think so get amongst and start trying.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>The web is a rather special place in that it connects all of us unlike regions, countries and borders. We are all here together without age, race, sex and sexual orientation, it’s just pixals on a screen. Without good values and empathy the web will not progress and would not be the place it is today.</p>
      <p>Being aware of this gives everybody the chance to come to the web and learn new skills and can give you a new career path without bias. It’s the pixels on the screen that prove how far you’ve come.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>Being able to recognise that programming isn’t easy and that you’ll get through it. Not being too hard on yourself because programming isn’t just tech skills. It’s about being a part of an industry and more is needed than just programming skills. Of course you need to be able to programme but being a programmer that has empathy, can talk to people, be organised, has confidence is far more desirable than pure tech skill. It’s a feeling of peace and to keep carrying on.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>I’ve rather enjoyed learning the core parts of this course but I would have to say the hardest part for me was actually getting my writing out. As adults I feel we don’t write as much as we used to, apart from a couple of sentences to our partners and friends. Having to think and write it down has been rather time consuming and scatty. It is a skill that I have lost but enjoying reconnecting to it again.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>I think that it is to reinstate that you are not just teaching us how to programme but to teach us how to get jobs and to be an all round better programmer and to carry on learning after we finish.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>No, I don’t think it has been a waste of time. I think you are trying to teach us skills to learn faster, learn better, be better humans and be more hirable. Of course there are points where you feel you are falling behind and are like ‘why the hell am I doing this when I’ve got so much else to do’. But I think if you didn’t pay attention through the core training, then you are not going to see that it was there for you, to help get you through this. Just in time learning, neuroplasticity and reflecting are tools for us to be better learners and then better programmers. The web is always changing, so teaching us only tech skills could be detrimental to our careers if we cannot adapt.</p>
